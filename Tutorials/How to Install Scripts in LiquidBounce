How to Install Scripts
1. Have LiquidBounce Latest Nightly Version (scroll down on downloads page) installed (Put in mods folder)
2. Navigate to %appdata%/.minecraft/LiquidBounce 1.8/scripts
3. Copy the Script from the Github (click the Raw button then do CTRL+A)
4. Create a new file called AnythingYouWant.js (must end with js) and paste the script you copied there
5. Launch Liquidbounce, it should be there! you should see it in the clickgui, and be able to bind and toggle it
6. If it doesnt work, try .scripts reload, and beyond that point you did something wrong.
